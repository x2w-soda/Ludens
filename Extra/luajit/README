Ludens Integration Notes
------------------------
LuaJIT has no CMake presets, we are using prebuilt libraies in prebuilt/ folder.
Include directory is same as source directory, LuaJIT headers are in src/ folder.
Make sure we are including src/lua.h instead of some other lua.h installed in system path.
HEAD points to commit eec7a8016c3381b949b5d84583800d05897fa960
